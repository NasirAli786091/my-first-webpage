            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>After learning Python Syntax, loops, user defined function and OOP (Object Oriented Programming), I
                  started making few projects like command-line Minesweeper game, Tic-Tac-Toe (PvP), Rock-Paper-scissor
                  against computer. Among those command-line games, Minesweeper was the trickest and challenging
                  one, even thouh I copied most of them from Google and Youtube, I learned many things and moving
                  forward.</p>

                  <h2>How I started?</h2>
                  <p>After Googling best Programming language to learn in 2021, Python was the most common result. Its
                        true because python syntaxs are very easy to remember and indentation rule which represents a
                        block of
                        code, is simple and can be grasp very easily after few practices. That is why most websites and
                        youtubers recommend Python to the beginners - like me. So I chose and gave my all into learning
                        and practicing.
                        Currently Practicing HTML and CSS.</p>

                  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                  <p>I am intrested in web development so currently on 10-March-2022, I'm learning HTML and CSS which
                        are building blocks of a website for web development. After that I will grab remaining concepts
                        of Python.
                        Its not that simple also its not Impossible.</p>
